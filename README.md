# README: Smart camera in the product shop    MLE(Make Life Easier)

## Project Overview
This B2B project aims to revolutionize the shopping experience by creating a real-time system that analyzes goods, adds them to a virtual cart, and displays the shopping list on a screen. Shoppers no longer need to manually scan items or interact with cashiers‚Äîsimply holding the item up to the camera completes the process.

## Mission üöÄ
To design an innovative and convenient system that accelerates shopping for everyday goods, minimizing time spent and enhancing customer comfort in retail stores.

---

## Introduction üåê
Modern lifestyles demand fast and efficient solutions for everyday tasks, including shopping. This system caters to individuals buying small quantities of items like ice cream, drinks, or snacks. Rather than replacing retail staff, the system offers an additional self-service option to enhance customer satisfaction and convenience.

---

## Goals üèÜ
- Accelerate the process of buying small items.
- Provide an easy-to-use self-service solution.
- Reduce operational costs by downsizing staff.
- Enhance customer satisfaction with advanced technology.
- Lower staff workload while maintaining excellent service quality.
